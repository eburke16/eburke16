## Hello. Thank you for stopping by!

These repositories are a work in progress.  Their purpoose is to offer examples of my work in R and Python in the following categories:

### - Machine Learning in Python
<ul>
  <li> Neural Networks
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/eburke16/Text-Mining">Text Mining</a> (<a href="https://github.com/eburke16/Text-Mining/blob/main/NLP.ipynb">NLP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eburke16/Text-Mining/blob/main/Document%20Similarity%20Analysis.ipynb">LSA</a>, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling, Text Summarization, Complexity Analysis)
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/eburke16/Decision-Trees">Decision Trees</a>  (Classification and Regression)
<li> Clustering Analysis (k-means and DBSCAN)
<li> Feature Extraction
<li> Autoencoders and Generative Networks
<li> Network Analysis
<li> Web Scraping (including Twitter analysis)
  </ul>

### - Data Visualizations in R using ggplot and shiny

### - Risk Analytics
<ul>
  <li> Read more about the risk analysis and stochastic Project Management Risk models I created using Monte Carlo simulation <a href="https://github.com/eburke16/RiskAnalytics">here</a>.
  </ul>
### - Geospatial Analyses I have conducted in ArcGIS and Python
<ul>
  <li> Authored Python-based ArcGIS tool to produce maps with near real-time U.S. hospitalization occupancy rates, creating potential for public and private sector strategic response plans.
<li> Conducted COVID-19 test site location-allocation analyses with ArcGIS Pro using Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Moran I) and K-Means Multivariate Clustering algorithms.
 </ul>
 
### - Quantitative Methods & Regression Analyses in R  
When and how to use the following regression techniques (and how to interpret the results):
  <ul>
    <li>Linear Regression
      <li>Non-Linear Regression Functions
      <li>Panel Data Regression
        <li>Logit and Probit Regression
          <li>Instrumental Variables with Regression
  </ul>
  
  
  

## GET TO KNOW ME
My love of learning extends beyond the classroom.
<ul>
  <li> My family and I have lived in four countries: <b>Haiti, Senegal, Italy,</b> and the <b>United States</b>.
  <li> I grew up in <b>Massachusetts</b>, but spent my summers working in <b>New Hampshire, South Carolina, Colorado</b>, and <b>Wyoming</b>.
    <li> I absolutely love exploring new places, learning new languages, experimenting with new recipes, and meeting new people.  
<li> I started learning how to play tennis in 2022 and I'm 100% hooked.  
</ul>
