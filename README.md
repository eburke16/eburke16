## Hello. Thank you for stopping by!


I love learning about how people and organizations are applying advancements in data science to solve complex problems. My goal is to develop repositories with examples of work I have built over the past few years in R and Python in the following categories:

### - Machine Learning in Python
<ul>
  <li> Neural Networks
<li> Text Mining (NLP, LSA, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling, Text Summarization, Complexity Analysis)
<li> Decision Trees  (Classification and Regression)
<li> Clustering Analysis (k-means and DBSCAN)
<li> Feature Extraction
<li> Autoencoders and Generative Networks
<li> Network Analysis
<li> Web Scraping (including Twitter analysis)
  </ul>

### - Data Visualizations in R using ggplot and shiny

### - Geospatial Analysese I have conducted in ArcGIS and Python

### - Quantitative Methods & Regression Analysis in R  
When and how to use the following regression techniques (and how to interpret the results):
  <ul>
    <li>Linear Regression
      <li>Non-Linear Regression Functions
      <li>Panel Data Regression
        <li>Logit and Probit Regression
          <li>Instrumental Variables with Regression
  </ul>
  
  
  

## GET TO KNOW ME
My love of learning extends beyond the classroom.
<ul>
  <li> My family has lived in four countries (<b>Haiti, Senegal, Italy,</b> and the <b>United States</b>).  We love exploring new places, learning new languages, experimenting with new recipes, and meeting new people.  
<li> I started learning how to play tennis in 2022 and I'm hooked.  It is far more challenging and fun than I expected!   
</ul>
